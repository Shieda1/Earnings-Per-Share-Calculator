    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the earnings per share<br> 
    What is the earnings per share?<br>
    The earnings per share (EPS) is a financial measurement that indicates the profitability of a company. It is a portion of the firm's profit that is allocated to every share of the stock.<br>
    How to calculate earnings per share?<br>
    To calculate earnings per share you should use the following formula:<br>
    earnings per share = (net income - preferred stock dividends) / average outstanding common shares<br>
    example: Bank x has $3,500,000,000 in net income, in preferred stock dividends and $1,800,000,000 worth of average oustanding common shares, calculate the earnings pershare.<br>
    Using the earnings pershare formula the answer will be:<br>
    earnings per share = (net income - preferred stock dividends) / average outstanding common shares<br>
    earnings per share = ($3,500,000,000 - $320,000,000) / 1,800,000,000<br>
    earnings per share = $1.76<br>
    Why use earnings per share?<br>
    The earnings pershare is used to estimate a company's value because it indicates how much money a company makes for each share of it's stock. High earnings pershare indecates a company of high value.<br>
